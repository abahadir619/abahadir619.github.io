       <h2><b>Who Am I and Why Did I Make CAN I HAZ CODE HELP? </h2></b>
        Coming into UC San Diego with no prior knowledge of computer science, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. It was a realm so different from all the other Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Diving into my first program was like writing an essay in a new language! But I soon found out how fun and rewarding it was to write those essays. As a result, I became an undergraduate tutor at the Computer Science department for courses that I previously excelled in. I noticed that with the tutoring system, students tend to learn and succeed more often! Plus, tutors learn a lot from the experience as well!

        From my experiences as a tutor, I strongly believe that having fun and learning through different techniques (visual, audible, etc) can really help people learn. And for this reason, I wanted to expand on my duties as a previous tutor (who still helps people out when possible) with this website! 

        Can I Haz Code Help is a site designed for beginner audiences, dedicated to teaching them a programming language called LolCode as opposed to more mainstream languages such as C, C++, Java, etc. I chose this language because it follows similar mechanics to those mainstream languages AND IT IS FUNNY. Who doesn't like a good laugh? :)

        Enjoy!
